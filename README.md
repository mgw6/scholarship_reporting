# Scholarship Reporting

This is a project I worked on for my executive internship at St. John Fisher College. 
I was given a few different spreadsheets that I had to merge all of the information on. 
They had different formats so I used this to combine them into one sheet. 

This is definitely a quick and dirty solution.
I was also learning pandas while I was doing it, so I wouldn't say it necessarily followed pandas best practices.
